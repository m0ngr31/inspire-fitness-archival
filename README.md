Current version: **1.0.3**

# About
This allows you to download workouts and programs from the Inspire Fitness app. I was worried that I'd lose access to the videos at some point so for archival purposes I wanted to have a copy of the videos for my machine.

# Running
The recommended way of running is to pull the image from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/m0ngr31/inspire-fitness-archival).

The first time you run, you'll need to include the `EMAIL` and `PASSWORD` environment variables so that it can authenticate and get the needed data.

It is highly recommended that you run with the `DRY_RUN` variable set so that you don't accidentally download hundreds or thousands of videos that you didn't intend to!

It will take a long time to download workouts (probably ~1GB each). If you have good bandwidth you can increase the `CONCURRENCY` variable to download more at once. If the app crashes or you cancel it, running again with the same variables will resume the download.

Alongside each workout video there will be a JSON file that contains information about the workout.
